main.m includes Lab S-8 problems 2.1 and 2.2.1, while the folders 2_2_2 and 2_2_3 include problems 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. These are split as Jordy Larrea Rodriguez wrote python code in the latter two folders instead of matlab.


The Python requirements can be install via

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Assuming some Python3 >= 3.9 is installed. IF there is difficulty with the matlab engine package: see https://pypi.org/project/matlabengine/.
