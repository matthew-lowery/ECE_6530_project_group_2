main.m includes Lab S-8 problems 2.1 and 2.2.1, while 2_2_23.ipynb includes problems 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. These are split as Jordy Larrea Rodriguez wrote python code instead of matlab!


Python requirements can be install via

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Assuming some Python3 >= 3.9 is installed. IF there is difficulty with the matlab engine package: see https://pypi.org/project/matlabengine/.
